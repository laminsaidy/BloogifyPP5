# Blogify

Blogify is a modern, feature-rich blog application that allows users to read, write, comment on blog posts, and categorize content. With a clean, responsive interface and rich functionality, Blogify is designed to provide a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. This project combines the power of React on the frontend and Django REST Framework on the backend. 

## User's Aim

The goal of Blogify is to provide an easy-to-use platform for readers who likes to just read about interesting topics without being distracted with images to share and explore content. Users can:

- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- Leave comments on posts to engage with the content.
- Categorize posts by topics for easier discovery.
- View posts with an infinite scroll for seamless browsing.
